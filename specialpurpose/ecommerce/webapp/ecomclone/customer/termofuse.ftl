		<strong class="faq-title2">Registration And Ordering </strong></br>
		<p>All usage and purchases made on this website are governed by these Terms and Conditions and by entering into the site you are bound to all the mentioned terms & conditions. We may update these terms and conditions from time to time and all users are requested to read through the changes every time you shop with us, if your visit to the site is after the date mentioned at the end.
		Once you complete your order with us we will confirm your order to you through an SMS or email address that you have provided us. We request you to make sure that you have access to the phone numbers and emails from the time of your order processing until the delivery has been completed. 
		It is your responsibility to make sure that you are available to receive the order at the time slot selected during the order or the time confirmed to you later. If we have to re-schedule the delivery due to your non-availability, delivery expenses will be charged to you.</p>
		<p>Cut-off Time - The cut off time for the same day delivery will be 10am and products ordered after the cut off time will be delivered the following specified day & time. After acceptance of the order, any items freshly added before the cut-off time will automatically form part of that order. Any order not being cancelled before the cut off time will be considered as booked & confirmed order and will be delivered at the scheduled time and address.</p>
			
		
		<div style="clear:both;"></div>
		<strong class="faq-title2">Price And Delivery Charges </strong></br>
		<p>The prices applicable for the products you ordered will be the price prevailing at the time of order. Generally the prices quoted for any product will be at the MRP if not discounted or not included in special offer. After placing an order if you subsequently amend your order to add items, the prices charged for new products added will be the prices quoted at the time you amended the order. However, if you add more of the same items which were in your original order, then the prices charged for these items will be the prices quoted at the time you confirmed your original order.
		When you place an advance booking the prices of some products may be corrected according to the prevailing price at the date of delivery. This is because prices of meat, vegetables and other perishable goods fluctuate every day and since we allow you to book order upto a week in advance, we need to pick the price prevailing at the time of delivery which sometimes turn to your benefit if the prices have reduced during that period.</p>
		<p>The prices stated on the website will be inclusive of any VAT payable. All orders above Rs. 1000 will be delivered at no cost. There is a delivery charge of Rs. 30 for orders less than 500 & Rs. 20 for orders above 500 to 1000.</p>			
		
		
		<div style="clear:both;"></div>
		<strong class="faq-title2">Payment & Delivery </strong></br>
		<p>Payment may be made by Cash, Debit or Credit Cards on delivery and Net Banking while placing your order. We <strong>DO NOT</strong> accept payment by Sodexho Vouchers or any other coupons at this moment. You cannot pay for your order by cheque. 

		<p>The Debit and Credit cards accepted by us are those listed on the web site on the date on which your order is placed.</p> 

		<p>In case of any failed payment we may approach a debt collection agency to collect the payment from you. You will compensate us in full against all expenses incurred by us for obtaining the payments from you.</p> 

		<p>The delivery date and time is generally selected during the time of confirmation of order. YouMart will do our best to suit the time slot you prefer. However, due to limitation with the maximum delivery in a particular slot we may have to close the slots once they are full. You will be able to choose from the next available slots.</p>

		<p>At the moment we are not covering entire Bangalore. We will be delivering only in selected areas in Bangalore and request you to check whether your area is covered before you start booking any order with YouMart.</p>

		<p>Products are subject to availability and during special offers we may limit the quantities of goods available to one single customer if we feel that his/her order is big to take advantage of the offer and that limits availability of goods to other customers. In the event of non-availability of any goods you order, we may offer a reasonable substitute. You have the liberty to reject any substitute item and we will refund the amount you have been charged for that substitute.</p> 

		<p>Once the order has been scheduled for delivery you are bound to be present to receive your order unless your non-availability is intimated to us before the cut-off time. Should you fail to be present for receiving the goods we will incur loss on the delivery expenses and cost to the extent of the perishable goods. In such a scenario we are entitled to charge you in full the price of perishable items contained in your order and the cost of delivery.</p>
