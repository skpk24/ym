		<strong class="faq-title2" onclick="displayAns('Ans47','show')">How is the 'Chef of the week' selected?</strong></br>
		<p id="Ans47" style="display:none">The whole concept of selecting one of the recipe owners as 'Chef of the Week' is an initiative to encourage homemakers and other enthusiastic chefs in our YouMart family and who are interested to join the group. We do a random pick after short-listing a few good ones, among the recipes uploaded until the date of such selection. This is not a competition and the recipes uploaded will be selected at the sole discretion of the YouMart management. As mentioned this is just an initiative to encourage homemakers and would appreciate your understanding that we will not be able to pick everyone at the same time.<br/><span class="faq-title2" style="text-align:right; float:right" onclick="displayAns('Ans47','close')">Close</span></p>
